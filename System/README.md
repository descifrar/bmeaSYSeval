    <li><strong>Initialization and Data Setup</strong>:<ul>
            <li>A <code>Strategy</code> object is instantiated with a DataFrame (<code>df</code>) that contains trading data.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Parameter Definitions</strong>:<ul>
            <li>Parameters for the strategy are defined in a dictionary called <code>params</code>. This includes:<ul>
                    <li>Moving averages (MAs) for various tickers (e.g., EURCAD, EURGBP, EURUSD, XAUUSD), specifying slow and fast MAs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Trade Costs</strong>:<ul>
            <li>The trade costs are defined, including spreads, commissions, and swap fees. Specific values for EURUSD are provided, along with default values for other instruments.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Applying the Strategy</strong>:<ul>
            <li>The strategy's parameters and trade costs are set using the corresponding methods (<code>set_params</code>  and <code>set_trade_costs</code>).</li>
            <li>The <code>evaluate</code> method is called to apply the trading logic to every tick of data in the DataFrame. This step is crucial as it simulates how the strategy would perform in real-time trading, considering all the defined parameters and rules.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Evaluation and Results</strong>:<ul>
            <li>After the evaluation, the final deposit value is printed. This value reflects the strategy's performance over the evaluated period.</li>
            <li>Additionally, you can inspect the DataFrame (<code>df</code>) to see how the deposit changed over time and to examine the open trades from the strategy.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>In the provided code, the strategy implementation focuses heavily on real-time analysis and decision-making for trading based on predefined parameters and conditions. The <code>evaluate()</code> method is pivotal as it iterates over each tick of data, applying trading logic such as opening, managing, and closing trades based on signals and market conditions. This real-time approach ensures that the strategy adapts dynamically to market movements as reflected in the DataFrame. By the end of evaluation, one can observe the final deposit value (<code>strategy.df['deposit'].iloc[-1]</code>) and any remaining open trades, providing insight into the strategy's performance over the data period. This approach allows for flexibility in adjusting trading parameters while maintaining a robust per-tick analysis method crucial for effective trading strategies.</p>
